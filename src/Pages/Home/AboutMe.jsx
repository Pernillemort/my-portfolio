                    <p className="hero--section--description">My name is Pernille Mortensen. I am 27 years old and currently based in Copenhagen. I previously pursued a professional career in volleyball, which I concluded in 2024. I have recently completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Medialogy and am now eager to further develop my skills and gain valuable experience in the professional workforce.
                    </p>
                    <p className="hero--section--description">I take pride in delivering strong performances and achieving goals not just for myself, but for the success of the team as a whole. I'm highly competitive and disciplined, with a strong drive to contribute to a positive and productive work environment. Leadership has always come naturally to me, and working in team-based settings has helped me collaborate effectively with a wide range of personalities. It has also taught me the importance of creating space for others to thrive and take the spotlight when it's their time to shine.
